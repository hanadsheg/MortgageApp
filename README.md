# 🏦 Lloyds Mortgage App (Virtual Experience)

This project was built as part of the **Lloyds Virtual Experience**, where I developed a mortgage app to practice using **React**, **JSON Server**, and front-end development skills.  

The app includes:  
- A **Home Page** with a **mortgage calculator** and displayed **reviews**.  
- A **Reviews Page** with user-submitted reviews.  
- A **Contact Us Page** and a **Feedback Page** for user interaction.  

It demonstrates clean, reusable component design with a mock backend for handling data.
